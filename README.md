- 👋 Hi, I’m @rudnitskiivol Ivan Rudnitski, software engineer
- 👀 I’m interested in PHP and Frontend Developing.

<b>My GitHub serves primarily as a repository of boilerplates for me. If it helps someone else, I'll be glad 😀</b>

<b>I saw some interest in my MODX plugin. Sorry, but I decided to clean up my github and reorganize because it has become like a trash can. You can download this via this link

<em>PS. If you want to get the plugin for free. The demo version is available on this marketplace. The source code was not encrypted, you can re-save the package for yourself</em>
